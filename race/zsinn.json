							"In ancient times there were two dominant Saurian races: The Saerith and the Zsinn. The Saerith were desert and plains dwellers who worshipped the sun and built a vast erudite empire. But its grandeur was built on the atrocities of slavery and the Zsinn were the enslaved.",
							"While the Saerith were bipedal humanoid with a reptilian nature, the Zsinn seemed much more closely linked to dinosaurs of ages past. Many Zsinn were conquered by the Saerith, enslaved, interbred, and genetically manipulated for various mundane labors."
